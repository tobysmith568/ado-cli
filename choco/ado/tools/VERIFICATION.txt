VERIFICATION
Verification is intended to assist the Chocolatey moderators and community
in verifying that this package's contents are trustworthy.

Binaries can be directly compared (checksum or direct binary comparison) against
the originals by downloading the originals from the GitHub release for the
corresponding version.

The GitHub releases can be found at https://github.com/tobysmith568/ado-cli/releases
and are named after the version of the software that they relate to with a "v" prefix.

For example, to verify the binaries for version 0.1.0, go to
https://github.com/tobysmith568/ado-cli/releases/tag/v0.1.0
and compare the binary against the file in the `Windows-Executable.zip` archive.
